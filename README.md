# Sleep Duration and Academic Performance Among University Students

# Research Question
Do students who sleep longer hours perform better academically?

# Motivation
For students' physical and mental well-being, sleep is essential. Due to stress, social engagements, and homework, university students frequently have unpredictable sleep patterns. Poor focus, decreased learning effectiveness, and inferior academic accomplishment can result from sleep deprivation.

This experiment aims to investigate if sleep duration affects students' academic performance as determined by their Grade Point Average (GPA). The study specifically looks into whether students who get more sleep typically have higher GPAs.

Gaining knowledge about this relationship might help one understand how lifestyle choices impact academic performance. The results may aid instructors and students in realizing how crucial balanced sleep schedules are to academic success.
